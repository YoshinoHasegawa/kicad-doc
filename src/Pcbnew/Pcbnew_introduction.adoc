Introduction to Pcbnew
----------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Pcbnew is a powerful printed circuit board software tool available
for the Linux, Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X operating systems.

Pcbnew is used in association with the schematic capture software
program Eeschema, which provides the Netlist file - this describes
the electrical connections of the PCB being designed.

A second program CvPcb is used to assign each component in the
Netlist produced by Eeschema, to a module that is used by Pcbnew.
This can be done either interactively or automatically using
equivalence files.

Pcbnew manages libraries of modules. Each module is a drawing of the
physical component including its footprint - the layout of pads
providing connections to the component. The required modules are
automatically loaded during the reading of the Netlist produced by
CvPcb.

Pcbnew integrates, automatically and immediately, any circuit
modification, by removal of any erroneous tracks, addition of the
new components, or by modifying any value (and under certain
conditions any reference) of the old or new modules, according to
the electrical connections appearing in the schematic.

Pcbnew provides a rats nest display, a hairline connecting the pads
of modules which are connected on the schematic. These connections
move dynamically as track and module movements are made.

Pcbnew has an active Design Rules Check (DRC) function which automatically
indicates any error of track layout in real time.

Pcbnew can automatically generate a copper plane, with or without
thermal breaks on the pads.

Pcbnew has a simple but effective autorouter to assist in the
production of the circuit board. An Export/Import in SPECCTRA dsn format
allows the use of more advanced auto-routers.

Pcbnew provides options specifically provided for the production of ultra
high frequency microwave circuits (such as pads of trapezoidal and complex
form, automatic layout of coils on the printed circuit, etc).

Pcbnew displays the elements (tracks, pads, texts, drawings and
more) as actual size and according to the following personal preferences:

* Display in full or outline.
* Display of the track/pad clearance.

Principal design features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pcbnew has an internal resolution of 1/10000 inch.

Pcbnew works on 16 layers of copper, plus 12 technical layers (silk
screen, solder mask, component adhesive, solder paste, drawings and
comments...) and manages in real time the hairline indication (rats
nest) of missing tracks.

The display of the PCB elements (tracks, pads, text, drawings...)
can be customizable:

* In full or outline.
* With or without track clearance.
* By hiding certain elements (copper layers, technical layers, zones of
copper, modules...), which is useful for high-density multi-layer
circuits.

For the complex circuits, the display of layers, zones, components
can be removed in a selective way for clarity on screen.

Modules can be rotated to any angle, with a step of 0.1 degree.

Pads can be round, rectangular, oval or trapezoidal (the latter is
necessary for the production of ultra high frequency circuits). In
addition several basic pads can be grouped.

Both the size of each pad, and the layers where they appear, can be
adjusted. The drilling of holes can be offset.

Pcbnew can automatically generate copper planes, with automatic
generation of thermal breaks around the pads concerned.

The Footprint Editor can be accessed from the Pcbnew toolbar. The
Editor allows creation or modification of a footprint from the PCB or a
library and then saved to either. A footprint saved to the PCB can be
subsequently saved to a library. In addition all footprints on the PCB
can be saved to a library by creating a footprint archive.

Pcbnew generates in an extremely simple way all the documents
necessary:

* Fabrication outputs:

** Files for Photoplotters in GERBER RS274X format.

** Files for drilling in EXCELLON format.

* Plot files in HPGL, SVG and DXF format.

* Plot and drilling maps in POSTSCRIPT format.

* Local Printout.

General remarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pcbnew requires a 3 button mouse. The 3rd button is mandatory.

Finally it should be noted that the diagrammatic tool Eeschema and
CvPcb are needed to create the required netlists.
