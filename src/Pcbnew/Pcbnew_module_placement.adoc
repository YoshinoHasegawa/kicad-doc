== Modules placement

=== Assisted placement

Whilst moving modules the module ratsnest (the net connections) can
be displayed to assist the placement. To enable this the icon
image:images/icons/modratsnest.png[] of the left toolbar must be
activated.

=== Manual placement

Select the module with the right mouse button then choose the Move
command from the menu. Move the module to the required position and
place it with the left mouse button. If required the selected module
can also be rotated, inverted or edited. Select Cancel from the menu
(or press the Esc key) to abort.

Here you can see the display of the module ratsnest during a move:

The circuit once all the modules are placed may be as shown:

=== General re-orientation of modules

Initially all modules inherit the same orientation that they had in
the library (normally 0).

If an alternative orientation is required for an individual module,
or all modules (for example all vertical) use the menu option
AutoPlace/Orient All Modules. This orientation can be selective (for
example to relate only to the modules whose reference starts with
"IC".

=== Automatic Module Distribution

Generally speaking, modules can only be moved if they have not been
"Fixed".  This attribute can be turned on and off from the pop-up
window (click right mouse button over module) whilst in Module Mode,
or through the Edit Module Menu.

As stated in the last chapter, new
modules loaded during the reading of the netlist appear piled up at
a single location on the board. Pcbnew allows an automatic
distribution of the modules to make manual selection and placement
easier.

* Select the option "Module Mode" (Icon image:images/icons/mode_module.png[] on the upper toolbar).
* The pop-up window activated by the right mouse button becomes:

If there is a module under the cursor:

image:images/Pcbnew_context_module_mode_module_under_cursor.png[]

If there is nothing under the cursor:

image:images/Pcbnew_context_module_mode_no_module_under_cursor.png[]

In both cases the following commands are available:

* *Move all Modules* allows the automatic distribution of all the
modules not Fixed.  This is generally used after the first reading of a
netlist.
* *Move new Modules* allows the automatic distribution of the modules
which have not been placed already within the PCB outline. This
command requires that an outline of the board has been drawn to
determine which modules can be automatically distributed.

=== Automatic placement of modules

==== Characteristics of the automatic placer

The automatic placement feature allows the placement of modules
onto the 2 faces of the circuit board (however switching a module onto
the copper layer is not automatic).

It also seeks the best orientation (0, 90, -90, 180 degrees) of the
module. The placement is made according to an optimization
algorithm, which seeks to minimize the length of the ratsnest, and
which seeks to create space between the larger modules with with
many pads. The order of placement is optimized to initially place
these larger modules with many pads.

==== Preparation

Pcbnew can thus place the modules automatically, however it is
necessary to guide this placement, because no software can guess
what the user wants to achieve.

Before an automatic placement is carried out one must:

* Create the outline of the board (It can be complex, but it must be
closed if the form is not rectangular).
* Manually place the components whose positions are imposed (Connectors,
clamp holes, etc).
* Similarly, certain SMD modules and critical components (large
modules for example) must be on a specific side or position on the
board and this must be done manually.
* Having completed any manual placement these modules must be "Fixed" to
prevent them being moved. With the Module Mode icon
image:images/icons/mode_module.png[] selected right click on the module
and pick "Fix Module" on the Pop-up menu. This can also be done through
the Edit/Module Pop-up menu.
* Automatic placement can then be carried out. With the Module Mode
icon selected, right click and select Glob(al) Move and Place â€“ then
Autoplace All Modules.

During automatic placement, if required, Pcbnew can optimize the
orientation of the modules. However rotation will only be attempted
if this has been authorized for the module (see Edit Module Options).

Usually resistors and non-polarized capacitors are authorized for
180 degrees rotation. Some modules (small transistors for example)
can be authorized for +/- 90 and 180 degrees rotation.

For each module one slider authorizes 90 degree Rot(ation) and a
second slider authorizes 180 degree Rot(ation). A setting of 0
prevents rotation, a setting of 10 authorizes it, and an
intermediate value indicates a preference for/against rotation.

The rotation authorization can be done by editing the module once it
is placed on the board. However it is preferable to set the required
options to the module in the library as these settings will then be
inherited each time the module is used.

==== Interactive auto-placement

It may be necessary during automatic placement to stop (press Esc
key) and manually re-position a module. Using the command Autoplace
Next Module will restart the autoplacement from the point at which
it was stopped.

The command Autoplace new modules allows the automatic placement of
the modules which have not been placed already within the PCB
outline. It will not move those within the PCB outline even if they
are not "fixed".

The command Autoplace Module makes it possible to re-place the
module pointed to by the mouse, even if its 'fixed' attribute is
active.

==== Additional note

Pcbnew automatically determines the possible zone of placement of
the modules by respecting the shape of the board outline, which is
not necessarily rectangular (It can be round, or have cutouts, etc).

If the board is not rectangular, the outline must be closed, so that
Pcbnew can determine what is inside and what is outside the outline.
In the same way, if there are internal cutouts, their outline will
have to be closed.

Pcbnew calculates the possible zone of placement of the modules
using the outline of the board, then passes each module in turn over
this area in order to determine the optimum position at which to
place it.
